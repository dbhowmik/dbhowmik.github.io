I am a person who spends for every hour of coding the same amount of time on creating READMEs
and documentation. I wanted to give the people, who have a quick look on the projects a
small info of the licensing conditions.  

I created a Gist on my Github with a bunch of License badges for including into markdown files.  
Simply copy and paste the badge with your selected License into the project's README.  
If you are searching for a license badge, check it out and let me know, you like it!

[Here is the magic list!](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba)
